This is the repository made for trying out things in Functional Programming Workshop. 

Functional Programming is something which does not have any side effects. ie. for same input, it would always give same output.

Map over list comphresion:- Take an example of 10000 elements of list and say we only want to compute first 10 elements 

reduce is a similar function to map. Instead of mapping a function to each value, reduce applies to a function to all values in a list to get a single output value. In Python3, you must import reduce from the functools module.

All of the functions map, reduce, filter will only calculate when it is used in the function

all returns True if all returns True
any returns True if any one is True

functors, monads, applicatives are very important concept in computer science.

We cannot apply functions to values in box(context) but we can use fmap for that.
